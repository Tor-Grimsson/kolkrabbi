# Gemini CLI Action Log: Monorepo Deployment Debugging

This log summarizes the actions taken by the Gemini CLI assistant to diagnose and resolve a deployment failure for the Kolkrabbi monorepo project on Vercel and Netlify.

## 1. Initial Project Review and Diagnosis

The initial goal was to understand why the monorepo project was failing to deploy.

* **Action:** Read file: `.claude_instructions.md`
    * **Reason:** To understand the project structure, tech stack, and coding guidelines.
* **Action:** Read file: `package.json` (root)
    * **Reason:** To verify the npm workspace configuration.
* **Action:** Read file: `apps/web/package.json`
    * **Reason:** To inspect the web app's build scripts and check for local dependencies. It was noted that all dependencies were hoisted to the root.
* **Action:** Search for files: `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml`
    * **Reason:** To check for existing deployment-specific configuration files. None were found.

**Diagnosis:** Gemini concluded that the deployment failures were due to a lack of platform-specific configuration. The deployment services did not know which application within the monorepo to build, what command to use, or where the output directory was located.

## 2. Solution Attempt 1: Add Platform Configuration Files

The first attempt to fix the issue was to create configuration files to guide the deployment platforms.

* **Action:** Create file: `vercel.json`
    * **Content:**
        ```json
        {
          "buildCommand": "npm run build:web",
          "outputDirectory": "apps/web/dist"
        }
        ```
    * **Reason:** To instruct Vercel how to build the `web` application.
* **Action:** Create file: `netlify.toml`
    * **Content:**
        ```toml
        [build]
          command = "npm run build:web"
          publish = "apps/web/dist"
        ```
    * **Reason:** To instruct Netlify how to build the `web` application.
* **Action:** Commit changes with message: `feat: add deployment configurations for Vercel and Netlify`

**Outcome:** The deployment on Netlify still failed. Analysis of the build log revealed the error `npm error Missing script: "build:web"`, which was caused by a conflicting "Base directory" setting in the Netlify UI. Gemini advised clearing this setting.

## 3. Solution Attempt 2: Stabilize the Build Environment

After clearing the UI settings, the build failed again, this time with an `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]` related to Vite's internal files. This suggested an unstable build environment.

* **Action:** Create file: `.nvmrc`
    * **Content:** `lts/iron`
    * **Reason:** To lock the Node.js version in the Netlify build environment to the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) release (v20), preventing issues from the newer, less stable v22.
* **Action:** Commit change with message: `fix(deploy): specify Node.js version for Netlify builds`

**Outcome:** The build failed with the exact same `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error, even with the correct Node.js version.

## 4. Solution Attempt 3: Regenerate Lockfile

The persistent error suggested a problem with the dependency tree itself, possibly an incompatibility in the `package-lock.json` file between the local (macOS) and build (Linux) environments.

* **Action:** Run command: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
    * **Reason:** To completely remove all installed dependencies and the existing lockfile.
* **Action:** Run command: `npm install`
    * **Reason:** To generate a new, clean `package-lock.json` file from scratch and ensure a consistent dependency tree.
* **Action:** Commit change with message: `chore: regenerate package-lock.json`

**Outcome:** The build failed again with the same `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error.

## 5. Solution Attempt 4: Isolate Workspace Dependency

The failure, even with a fresh lockfile, pointed to a subtle module hoisting or resolution issue within the npm workspace on Netlify.

* **Action:** Modify file: `apps/web/package.json`
    * **Reason:** To add `vite` as an explicit `devDependency` to the `web` app's own `package.json`. This encourages npm to create a `node_modules` structure that ensures Vite can find its internal files when run from that workspace.
* **Action:** Run command: `npm install`
    * **Reason:** To update the `package-lock.json` to reflect the change.
* **Action:** Commit change with message: `fix(deploy): add explicit vite dependency to web app`

**Outcome:** The build failed again with the same `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error.

## 6. Final Attempt (Interrupted): Update Build Tooling Version

As a final measure, Gemini identified that the issue might be a bug within the specific version of `npm` being used by Netlify's build environment.

* **Action:** Modify file: `netlify.toml`
    * **Reason:** To add an environment variable (`NPM_VERSION = "10.9.0"`) to force Netlify to use a newer version of npm for the build process.
* **Action:** Commit change with message: `fix(deploy): specify npm version for Netlify builds`

**Outcome:** The conversation was terminated due to API rate limits immediately after this commit was made. The result of this final attempt is unknown.
